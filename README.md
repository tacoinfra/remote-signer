# Tezos Remote Signer

This is a Python Flask app that implements a Tezos Remote Signer.
It receives messages from the Tezos baking client and returns signatures
after applying policy and/or using an HSM.

Configuration is via a file in the current working directory called
`keys.json` which is, as one would expect, a JSON file.  Here is a
quick example for a local signer:

```
{
	"signer": "local",
	"ratchet": "mockery",
	"keys": {
		"tz1ZjN1B5a...": {
			"public_key": 'edpkuH1HEpS...",
			"secret_key": 'edsk3t9PBQg..."
		}
	},
	"policy": {
		"baking": 1,
		"voting": ["aye", "pass"]
	}
}
```

This configuration will sign baking requests for the configured key.
It will also allow votes to be cast as long as they are all "aye" or
"pass".

The code is modular and extensible as described below.

## Signer Class

Other than a constructor, objects of class Signer implement a single
method `sign` which takes a public key hash and a `SignatureRequest`
object returning a signature encoded as a base58 string with the
appropriate prefix.

### ValidateSigner

This class applies local policy to the request (validates) and if said
policy allows, passes the request to a configured "subsigner" which may
sign the request.  This class is called regardless of the configuration
in `keys.json`, but the configuration will control its behaviour.

First, a ValidateSigner will evaluate the policy block defined in
`keys.json` and ensure that the request complies with it.  "policy" is a
dictionary and we currently define two keys: "baking" and "voting".  The
former is a boolean and if true then all baking requests (preendorsement,
endoresement, block) are allowed.  The latter is a list of strings:
"aye", "nay", or "pass".  If this is defined then votes matching any of
the string in the list are allowed.

Next, a ChainRatchet is applied if the SignatureRequest is of type
"baking".  This is sometimes called a watermark in other remote signers.
It is a mechanism by which we ensure that we do not sign baking requests
at a level and round less than or equal to a similar request that we
have already signed.  In doing this, we provide an additional control
which prevents double baking.

After this, ValidateSigner will call the configured "subsigner" which
will should return a valid signature.

### LocalSigner

This is an implementation of Signer which signs in software from secret
keys that are configured in `keys.json`.  The example above shows the
way to define them.

This class makes a good example of how to add your own signer.

### HsmSigner

This class uses the
[py-hsm module](https://github.com/bentonstark/py-hsm) to
support PKCS#11 signing operations, which means it should support the
following HSMs:

* Gemalto SafeNet Luna SA-4
* Gemalto SafeNet Luna SA-5
* Gemalto SafeNet Luna PCIe K5/K6
* Gemalto SafeNet Luna CA-4
* SafeNet ProtectServer PCIe
* FutureX Vectera Series
* Cavium LiquidSecurity FIPS PCIe Card
* Utimaco Security Server Simulator (SMOS Ver. 3.1.2.3)
* OpenDNSSEC SoftHSM 2.2.0 (softhsm2)

Note that we have only tested it on [AWS CloudHSM](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudhsm/), which is based on the Cavium LiquidSecurity FIPS PCIe Card.

### IBM Hyper Protect Crypto Services - GREP11

The current implementation supports grep11 TLS mutual authen to a grep11 server.  It has been tested on HPVS 2.1 Crypto Appliance.
https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/hpvs/2.1.x?topic=crypto-express-network-api-secure-execution-enclaves

The file keys.json.hpcsgrep11.sample provides a configuration sample

The public key, public key hash and secret blob can be created using the createtezos tools available at https://github.com/jyg007/hpcstezos
This program however requires you deploy a grep11 service with IBM Hyper Protect Virtual Server 1.* or 2.1.
To connect this grep11 server, you will use some TLS certificates that you can reuse for the remote-signer program.

Create your keys the following ways:
$ ./createtezoskey
p2pk66EnR4uFKpTmZj9z5Fg9J2J8KmLb7LCwZe5QPySs8JurcTP1PXM
tz3gvQDEZfYakYEcqaL3ESQGbbNhwVHXAQmd

In the directory, you will see two files tz3VaktXwZtyqYgN6439Shdqo2E2uvGh75r8.sk.hex and tz3VaktXwZtyqYgN6439Shdqo2E2uvGh75r8.der

The content of the file tz3VaktXwZtyqYgN6439Shdqo2E2uvGh75r8.sk.hex is to be used in your keys.json configuration file .  Associated public and public key has are provided as output of the command.

Start the remote signer as:
FLASK_APP=signer  flask  run --host=0.0.0.0

Pay attention to the url you used to specify the grep11 server and make sure the hostname is defined in your /etc/hosts
The connection pem files has to be retrieved from your grep11 configuration.  see the grep11 documentation for this at the above provided link.

On your tezos node, to register your address generated with the createtezos command, issue the following:
$ ./tezos-client import secret key hsmremote  "http://localhost:5000/tz3gvQDEZfYakYEcqaL3ESQGbbNhwVHXAQmd"

replace locahost by the hostname or ip addresse of your flask application server

### MockSigner

This one is just used for unit testing and may be deprecated in the
future as LocalSigner should be good enough for unit tests.

### Writing your own Signer

The basic structure of a signer is, as mentioned above, a class with
an initialiser and a single method named `sign`.  This method takes
a public key hash encoded in base58 and a SignatureRequest and should
return a base58 encoded signature.

Here is some example code:

```
from pyblake2 import blake2b
from src.signer import Signer

class MyHSMSigner(Signer):
    def __init__(self, config):
        # The config (keys.json) is passed in, variables can be
        # extracted and used here.
        self.hsm = connect_to_my_hsm

    def sign(self, pkh, sigreq):
        # First, we must associate our public key hash with whatever
        # handle the HSM uses to identify the key.  This mapping should
        # be stored in keys.json:

        hndl = get_hsm_handle_for(pkh)

        # Now, we hash the data in the way the Tezos expects.
        # Note that this step is not required if the signature
        # code already does it, e.g. pytezos Key.sign() does
        # this for you.

        hashed_data = blake2b(hex_to_bytes(sigreq.get_payload()),
                              digest_size=32).digest()
        sig = self.hsm.sign(hndl, hashed_data)

        # And our parent class has a method to base58 encode the
        # result in the correct way for us.  Again, note that this
        # isn't necessary for the local signer as pytezos Key.sign()
        # does this for you.

        return Signer.b58encode_signature(sig)
        
```

## ChainRatchet class

A ChainRatchet keeps track of what level and round previous baking
operations were signed and helps the remote-signer refuse to sign further
requests at the same or lower levels in order to provide an additional
protection against double baking.

All children are expected to inherit from ChainRatchet and implement
both a constructor (`__init__`) and a method `check`.  The constructor
is completely implementation dependent.

The `check` method takes three arguments: signature type, level, and
round.  `check` must ensure that all previous calls to it across all
running instances of `remote-signer` have not received a valid signature
for the signature type and the level/round at or below the previous max.
`ChainRatchet` provides a `check` method which can be used.

ChainRatchet's are expected to throw exceptions on failure.  For best
results, import werkzeug's abort function and use it:

```
from werkzeug.exceptions import abort

    abort(410, f"Will not sign {level}/{round} because ratchet " +
               f"has seen {self.lastlevel}/{self.lastround}")
```

A pseudocode example would be:

```
class MyChainRatchet:
    def __init__(dbname):
        self.db = connect_to_my_db(dbname)

    def check(self, sig_type, level, round):
        # These operations must be performed under a lock, unless you
        # have some interesting DB logic which achieves the same result.
        with self.db.lock():
            # First we update our object's idea of what levels and rounds
            # have come before by consulting our external data source

            self.lastlevel, self.lastround = self.db.get_levelround(sig_type)

            # The parent class' check method will throw an appropriate
            # exception if self.lastlevel, self.lastround are the same
            # or greater than the level and round passed in.

            super().check(sig_type, level, round)

            # NOTE: it is very important that an exception is thrown if
            # you are unable to update the backend storage with the new
            # level and round information or you may allow double baking.

            self.db.update_db(sig_type, level, round)
```

In the above example, we refer to "interesting DB logic which achieves
the same result".  This could be an atomic test and set operation if
your datastore supports it.

### DDBChainRatchet

This ChainRatchet uses Amazon AWS' DynamoDB as a backend to store the
current level and round.  To configure it, you need to set two environment
variables: `REGION` and `DDB_TABLE`.  `REGION` is your AWS region and
`DDB_TABLE` is name of the table within DynamoDB that your ratchet
is stored.

### SQLiteChainRatchet

This ChainRatchet uses a local sqlite database as a backend to store the current level and round.
To create the DB:

$ cat <<EOF > s.sql
CREATE TABLE  signature(sigtype TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
lastblock NUMERIC,
lastround NUMERIC
);
EOF

$ sqlite3 test.db < s.sql

Specify the pathname of your database in the db attibute of the keys.json file:
{
        "signer": "grep11",
        "db": "/data/tezos/remote-signer/sig.db",
...

A


### MockChainRatchet

This ChainRatchet stores the current level and round in memory and is
used in testing because the level and round are not persistent between
invocations.

## Security Notes

Please note that this software does not provide any authentication or authorization. You will need to take care of that yourself. It simply returns the signature for valid payloads, after performing some checks:
* Is the message a valid payload?
* Does the message begin with a 0x01 or 0x02? Indicating it is a baking or endorsement, rather than a 0x03 transfer.
* Is the message within a certain threshold of the head of the chain? Ensures you are signing valid blocks.
* For baking signatures, is the block height of the payload greater than the current block height? This prevents double baking.
