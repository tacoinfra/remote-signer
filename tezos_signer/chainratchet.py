#
# A Chain Ratchet is expect to ensure that we do not sign different
# transactions at the same level.  An implementation of Chain Ratchet
# stores the level of the last successful transaction for each signature
# type(sig_type).  The check() method is passed the level of the incoming
# request, if it is higher than the stored level then the stored level
# is updated and True is returned. Otherwise, we throw an exception
# specifying what went wrong.  Keep in mind that the text of the exception
# will be returned to the client and so be careful what you log locally
# versus what is exposed to clients.
#
# NOTE: the code that inherits from ChainRatchet is expected to
#       keep self.lastlevel and self.lastround up to date before
#       calling check().
